Large companies have spent the last two years focusing on integrating AI into their applications, and now the question will be - how does AI help our topline or bottom line? Is it helping increase revenue, or decrease cost? See - I think AI has been a big reason for the recent layoffs across multiple companies. So that executives can say - through my initiative, I saved the company X% by automating labor (separate question as to whether this actually happened or not).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So let’s say you are building an LLM based application. How do you make sure that the product experience you are building around LLMs is not going to be scrapped? For this, you need some way to make sure the application is doing a good job. In this article, I go through the steps involved in doing so - turns out, it is not so simple as (only) making API calls to your favorite LLM provider.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2023, LLM context windows were only up to a thousand tokens or so, which made it impossible to ingest large documents longer than a few pages in a single LLM call. A lot of startups took advantage of this, and built applications that chat over longer documents using retrieval augmented generation (RAG) such as PDF chat. However, within a year, LLM providers like GPT, Anthropic, Google incorporated chat with documents within their system, and also increased context windows by orders of magnitude to hundreds of thousands, and even millions of tokens. Because of this, many of these early startups crashed, or had to significantly modify their strategy. The lesson here is that any company working in the area of generative AI needs to constantly evaluate the product they are building (or built) - and look from the customer perspective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you were a customer, would you use company X’s product built on top of an LLM? Or just go to your favorite LLM provider and do the same task there? At the same time, if you are offered to do a very niche, obsecure task powered by LLMs this is uselsess. The trick is to find the right balance to attract users, and grow from there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-do-you-wow-users&quot;&gt;How Do You Wow Users?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unless you are a startup with billions of dollars to burn, you can’t wow your users through AI alone. That’s the hard reality- your users have already been wowed by GPT or Claude or Gemini, etc. But if you are a company that’s been in the business for atleast a few years - chances are that your users find something useful, otherwise they would have left. What you can do though - is make users even more impressed by offering them new GenAI features, or making it easier to do whatever task they’ve come to you for - either on the web or in person. Ultimately, it comes down to data. What do you know about X person, to help them perform Y task? Given that data, LLMs are very capable of making basic decisions, and giving information to users in a consumable way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s say you build a LinkedIn content creation platform. Based on a user’s behavior, you can give them post suggestions. But if you don’t have basic personalization, the same user can just make a LinkedIn post on their favorite LLM app. I also think that recommendation systems are here to stay in a big way. The ‘retrieval’ aspect of RAG is nothing but a text based recommender.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;a href=&quot;/assets/images2/walmart-rec.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images2/walmart-rec.png&quot; alt=&quot;[Walmart Rec Sys](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.12228)&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In October 2024, Walmart &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.12228&quot;&gt;released a paper&lt;/a&gt; where they aligned text, visual, and graph data for leveraging LLM based recommendations to users. On a light hearted note - this could be thought of as flipping RAG on it’s head or generative augmented recommendation (GAR :grin:).
I think we will see more and more of these types of products where LLMs are closely integrated with existing ML pipelines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;deliver-with-a-bang&quot;&gt;Deliver With A Bang&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok, so you’ve figured out how to wow your users using GenAI, and decided to develop this further. But how do you make sure your app delivers as expected? And how do you define what “good” is? This question turns out to be extremely important, and often underestimated for a few different reasons:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Traditional ML applications have well defined purposes and labels to train on. Whereas GenAI opens up the UX to all sorts of user inputs.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;GenAI is by definition “generative” meaning the outputs are not bounded. A polar example is a classification task such as sentiment classification - which has a few output categories.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The bar is extremely high. If you promise customers a more natural experience for interacting - they expect human-like conversations. And turns out, humans are extremely good at detecting subtle patterns.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You need a way to benchmark your model before putting it out to users. This is where internal testing helps. A way to assess quality is by getting quick feedback, and iterating fast. In the Lex Fridman podcast featuring Dario and Amanda from Anthropic - Anthropic uses a similar method to test quality, though they have the ability to actually test with large audiences. For a smaller user base, this approach might mean more leveraging internal opinions across multiple groups before putting it in production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;a href=&quot;/assets/images2/lex-dario-amanda.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images2/lex-dario-amanda.png&quot; alt=&quot;Lex Fridman Podcast | [Lex Fridman Podcast](https://lexfridman.com/dario-amodei-transcript/#chapter15_constitutional_ai)&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, while it is possible for humans to grade a few tens or humderds of examples, this becomes hard to scale. One problem is that grading just takes a lot of time. Each time you deploy a small variation, grading tens or hundreds of examples becomes expensive. Let’s think about how to automate this. One option is if your task has well defined constaints. Let’s say your users are asking questions based on a user manual - maybe a fridge product. Here answering the user query happens in two steps. First, the relevant context needs to be retrieved from the user manual, and second the answer generated from the context. In this case, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.confident-ai.com/docs/guides-rag-triad#:~:text=What%20is%20the%20RAG%20Triad,is%20using%20the%20optimal%20hyperparameters&quot;&gt;RAG triad&lt;/a&gt; comes in handy. The idea is that you evaluate how relevant the output answer is to both the user query and retrieved context, as well as the relevance of retrieved context to the user query.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;a href=&quot;/assets/images2/rag-triad.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images2/rag-triad.png&quot; alt=&quot;[RAG Triad](https://docs.confident-ai.com/docs/guides-rag-triad#:~:text=What%20is%20the%20RAG%20Triad,is%20using%20the%20optimal%20hyperparameters)&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you do use the RAG triad, you still need to find out a way to accuractely score the outputs relative to query or context. In case the response is more open-ended (e.g. generating a marketing or sales message), evaluation becomes more nuanced - potentially domain specific. The best path forward would be to first get human domain experts to judge a bunch of responses, and subsequently develop a model to replicate these scores. Typically, the way you do this is through an LLM judge. The key here is to use a good LLM judge and develop an LLM judge prompt that does a good job of representing the human judge. Before going down this path - consider the data you are collecting from human judgement as well. I’ve seen that humans can differ in scoring methods especially in complex tasks. Additionally, the same person can give different scores at different times based on how the data they have seen has influenced them. It happens to all of us at some point. Try to get multiple humans to judge the same content - trust me, you will be grateful down the line as you will have a solid dataset.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, lets talk about how you develop an LLM judge. This becomes a typical data science problem once you have enough data - you distribute into a train and test set. There are multiple ways you can use the train set. You can distill this into a set of rules for an LLM judge prompt. Let’s say you had scores from 1-5, 1 being horrible fail, and 5 being excellent. You could send 10s or 100s of these examples through a prompt and distill rules for evaluating content. You could also add few-shot examples to the judge prompt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second part is evaluating the performance of the LLM judge. Correlation between the judge and human scores using metrics like Kendall’s correlation and Spearman’s correlation give a quick indicator of how well the two match each other. However, I like to look closer at metrics like class based precision and recall. Often, a quick view at a confusion matrix can be illuminating. It could also make sense to binarize the response - e.g. 1-3 denote fail, and 4-5 are pass. In this case, you could look at which category the LLM judge is performing well in and which it is failing, and also what is important to capture. Is it important to have high precision? Is the data skewed? These are all important factors while evaluating performance and seeing if you need to change the judge prompt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Often, you might have imbalanced data. After all, didn’t you build your prompt to be really good? Here again LLMs can be used to generate synthetic data. The approach I like to use is to take a decent response, and slightly modify it to be bad. Now, you’ve bootstrapped your dataset to handle diverse cases. One final thing I want to say here, is that you might decide to use a smaller model such as an embeddings based classifier, as your judge. One thing to note is that this would have less interpretability. Another issue is that it cannot easily be scaled to a scenario where there is less data. This is where synthetic data helps, as you can use it to bootstrap edge cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;learning-and-constantly-improving&quot;&gt;Learning And Constantly Improving&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now you’ve deployed your model. Give yourself a pat on the back, sit back, and let the wins come in as customer after customer is wowed by your application. That has to be the case - right? After all, haven’t you tested it out on internal experts, and your project has been given a green light by the higher-ups? Unfortunately your customers didn’t know that (or didn’t care that you put in your heart and soul - maybe not their top priority). So what now - one option is to scrap what you did, return back to the drawing board, and try again. And again, and again. Until you are exhausted, and the entire org is exhausted - not knowing what went wrong and where.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While this sounds funny, it’s unfortunately something I’ve seen mutiple times. It is important to learn from what went wrong, and improve. This is why it is important to have a robust data storage process - so that you can go back, and understand why your application was not as hot as you thought. Maybe its something simple that you can fix next time. A/B testing is a common practice, where you segment your user base into two groups - one receives the experiment, the other receives the control. Try to make life as simple as possible - make populations large and well defined. Don’t have too many variants that can confuse these analyses. And don’t change so many things at once, that you can’t make a coherent analysis at the end. Remember ultimately you need to convince your peers and decision makers. While you might be able to do a complex analysis of multiple different variants and experiments and list 10 key takeaways, decision makers are more easily convinced by simple takeaways, and are more skeptical, the more complex your conclusions are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;takeaways&quot;&gt;Takeaways&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the learnings that stood out for me have been through trial by fire. I hope that these learnings can help you preemptively put your best foot forwards and produce amazing AI based applications that drive progress. AI is here to stay - and can really help those of us who are busy getting pulled in different directions - to delegate tasks. But it is important to properly delegate - otherwise you are left with a larger mess to clean up than you started off with. Keep it simple, remember that nothing has really changed in how you approach problems. You still have to solve for customers, learn through data, and keep improving. Don’t get pressured into making hasty decisions. Everyone that matters will be thankful for it.&lt;/p&gt;

In this article I’ll talk about one raga in Carnatic music called Bhairavi (different from the Hindustani Bhairavi) which is not one out of the 72, but derived from 2 of the ragas. Such derived scales are also called as Janya ragas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;a href=&quot;/assets/images2/melakarta.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images2/melakarta.png&quot; alt=&quot;South Indian Melakarta Ragas | [Basavarajtalwar](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Basavarajtalwar)&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But first of all, why are there only 72 Melakarta Ragas? It is because of mathematics and the way the human ear is sensitive in distinguishing pitch One super interesting concept is that the minimal difference between consecutive notes - whether it is semitones in Western classical music or adjacent swaras in Indian music, the difference between them is the same. This fascinatingly suggests that human ears can basically distinguish a very specific frequency interval - or this could just be the way music accidently evolved over millenia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back to Indian music - how does the number 72 come about? Every scale has 8 notes (S,R,G,M,P,D,N,S) and 3 are fixed (S,P,S). There are 3 possible R, G, D, and N. However there are only 2 possible Ms. The first 36 Melakarta ragas correspond to the M1; the latter 36 correspond to M2. Each of the 36 are grouped into 6 subgroups as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1:6 → R1, G1&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;7:12 → R1, G2&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;13:18 → R1, G3&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;19:24 → R2, G2&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;25:30 → R2, G3&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;31:36 → R3, G3&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;bhairavi-raga-and-composition&quot;&gt;Bhairavi Raga and Composition&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bhairavi has different ascending and descending scales as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ascending: S R2 G2 M1 P D2 N2 S&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Descending: S N1 D1 P M1 G2 R2 S&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see both ascending and descending would fall into the 19 through 24 bucket. In fact, ascending Bhairavi is Karaharapriya (Melakarta 22) wherease descending is Natabhairavi (Melakarta 19). Here is what Bhairavi sounds like:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;source src=&quot;/assets/av/scale-bhairavi.mp3&quot; type=&quot;audio/mpeg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/audio&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Carnatic music varnas are a type of composition that are neat, precise compositions. They form the basis for a musician’s understanding of characteristic swaras and patterns in a raga. Viriboni is a varna in raga Bhairavi composed by Pacchimiriyam Adiappayya. It is a particularly difficult varna as it is in Ata Thala. Ata Thala is a notoriously difficult tala (beat) in Carnatic music as you have 14 beats per cycle, whereas typically you have 8 beats per cycle. The larger number of beats makes it harder to keep track and focus, but makes for more elaborate compositions. Here is what Viriboni sounds like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;bhairavi-raga-signatures-and-exercises&quot;&gt;Bhairavi Raga Signatures and Exercises&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This first exercise is what I use as a warmup before Aalapane - which is freestyle melodic singing based on the ragas without any notes (sort of like a jazz solo, except without particular attention to timing but more attention to melody, patterns and speed). In this exercise I go through the scale, practicing both speed and accuracy - sort of like a guitar shred.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;SRGMPNDS-NDPMGRS&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;RGMPDNSR-SNDPMGR&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;GMPDNSRG-RSNDPMG&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;MPDNSRGM-GRSNDPM&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;PDNSRGMP-MGRSNDP&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;audio controls=&quot;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;source src=&quot;/assets/av/viriboni-scale-ex1.mp3&quot; type=&quot;audio/mpeg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/audio&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The audio excerpt below is a classic Bhairavi pattern to evoke the descending N swara (SGRGMPDP NDP)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;audio controls=&quot;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;source src=&quot;/assets/av/viriboni-scale-ex2.mp3&quot; type=&quot;audio/mpeg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/audio&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The excerpt below demonstrates the dissonant N while ascending and descending and is another classic pattern in Bhairavi. Interestingly this signature pattern actually violates the basic rule of Bhairavi as it uses the N1 while going up and N2 while going down! (PDN1DPDM PDRSN2DN2)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;audio controls=&quot;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;source src=&quot;/assets/av/viriboni-scale-ex3.mp3&quot; type=&quot;audio/mpeg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/audio&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The excerpt below touches on reaching the high S and lingering over it which is very important during Bhairavi Aalapane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;audio controls=&quot;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;source src=&quot;/assets/av/viriboni-scale-ex4.mp3&quot; type=&quot;audio/mpeg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/audio&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The excerpt illustrates a longer version of what a singer typically does after warming up and reaching the higher notes. This has a bunch of cascading repetitive patterns building from the small to the large. It is one of my favorite aspects of Raga Aalapane.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;a href=&quot;/assets/images2/github.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images2/github.png&quot; alt=&quot;GitHub logo | [Bo-Yi Wu](https://www.flickr.com/photos/appleboy/13158675193)&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been using the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes&quot;&gt;minimal mistakes theme on GitHub&lt;/a&gt; to create a website. So far I’ve loved it for my use cases.
Originally I was using Wixsite for a website. But I’m so used to writing on editors that I like, or Medium’s WYSIWYG editor, that I became quite annoyed by Wix.
Wix is like powerpoint, except for a website. Yes everything is customizable and there’s movable boxes. But I prefer something minimalist and robust, for blogs. I
could have gone ahead and made a WordPress site, but GitHub pages is free! And I love the idea of coding in interfaces as needed e.g. google analytics, comment sections, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GitHub pages uses Jekyll, which is a static-site generator based in the programming language Ruby. In playing around with creating a GitHub pages site, I absolutely fell in love
with Ruby, that I had to learn from scratch. Ruby essentially imports all the libraries (called Ruby gems) needed for a specific project (e.g. website), so there are no dependency
issues! By contrast, I use Python a whole bunch, but had a huge issue building a website with a Python based static site generator known as Pelican, due to dependency issues
(maybe worth writing and article on this in of itself). The one issue with a GitHub page site is that it does not look as fresh as some paid WordPress options. For bloggers, Ghost
is becoming popular, although this also features monthly charges. Eventually I might switch to a paid option, with a better look. But for now, I’m quite comfortable with GitHub.
I like writing on my laptop editor in Markdown format (right now using Atom), and committing to GitHub. But it’s important for me to have a custom domain name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I obtained my favorite domain name  (firstnamelastname.com) - (I know I’m lucky!) on Google domains. While I found it relatively straightforward to set up a custom http domain on GitHub pages using a CNAME record, it was harder to make this domain secured through https, that GitHub just introduced a couple of years back. I would get an “ERR_TOO_MANY_REDIR” message. Probably due to a misconfiguration of the CNAME record, causing a browser to go back and forth between URLs. I did not have this message pop up when I didn’t enforce https.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was annoying as I didn’t like people seeing “not secure” right next to my website. It just looks unprofessional. Maybe I’m being too nit picky. Google search didn’t offer up any solutions that worked, and I ended up finding something that worked through a bunch of combinations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;a href=&quot;/assets/images2/dns.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images2/dns.png&quot; alt=&quot;DNS configurations by Skanda Vivek&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, I created alias name records to point my domain to the 4 IP addresses for GitHub pages site as &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.GitHub.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-GitHub-pages-site/managing-a-custom-domain-for-your-GitHub-pages-site&quot;&gt;described in the GitHub website&lt;/a&gt;. Next, I created a CNAME record pointing to my github.io site. Previously I named the URL prefix as www, which is what I was told on other blogs. But that didn’t work. But this time I named the URL prefix as https, which did the trick!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;a href=&quot;/assets/images2/github-https.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images2/github-https.png&quot; alt=&quot;GitHub pages https config  by Skanda Vivek&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, I went to my GitHub pages site repository settings. Under pages, I added the custom domain pointing to my firstnamelastname.com website. Next I clicked on enforce https, and this seemed to work! Note: GitHub still says that my site is improperly configured, but everything seems to work just fine. I hope this is useful to anyone wanting to create a GitHub pages site and enforce https!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Skanda Vivek</name></author><category term="blog" /><category term="GitHub" /><category term="snipette" /><summary type="html">https is a big deal when it comes to security, professional look, and SEO rankings.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Rich Dad/Poor Dad</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/blog/rich-poor/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Rich Dad/Poor Dad" /><published>2021-07-08T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2021-07-08T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/blog/rich-poor</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/blog/rich-poor/">&lt;p&gt;I was pleasantly surprised this financial best seller emphasizes the mindset of creating value for the life you want,
rather than running after money. Kiyosaki’s birth father was an intellectual man, but apparently lost his money because of poor financial
decisions. The rich dad was Kiyosaki’s friend’s dad, who taught him lessons in financial literacy and financial freedom, through allowing Kiyosaki
to follow in his footsteps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;a href=&quot;/assets/images2/richpoor.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images2/richpoor.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Book cover by Skanda Vivek&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through the book, Kiyosaki illustrates the financial lessons he learned by working for his friend’s father. One such lesson is that the rich don’t work for money.
To me this statement makes sense as Kiyosaki explains it - the middle class is caught in a never ending trap of making stable but low wages. As a result,
many hardworking folks have to work extremely hard to make ends meet, sometimes working multiple jobs. This in combination with a lack of accounting for
financial conditions and a tendency to waste money on non-essential items leads to a cycle of wealth loss and poverty. However, one thing he says about “rich”
people particularly stands out. It’s not about getting rich quickly through some scheme or some clever way no one has ever thought of. And it doesn’t even
have anything to do with money. He said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Be an observer, not a reactor to your emotions. Most people do not know that it is their emotions that are doing the thinking. Your emotions are
your emotions, but you have got to do the thinking.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think this is a profound statement, that does not have to do only with making money. But also leading a rich, fulfilling life not necessarily associated
with a dollar amount. Mastering the mind is a crucial step it seems, to being financially successful. If you read my &lt;a href=&quot;https://skandavivek.com/blog/gandhi/&quot;&gt;post on Gandhi&lt;/a&gt;, you will see that the lessons
he writes about (“To attain [perfection], one has to become absolutely passion-free in thought, speech and action; to rise above the opposing currents of love and hatred, attachment and repulsion”)
resonates with Kiyosaki’s ideas too. If you had told me 2 years ago that Gandhi’s book and a financial best seller
have the same underlying theme, I would have never believed you!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next lesson talks about learning the tools of financial literacy: namely assets vs liabilities. Kiyosaki simply states: the rich buy assets, the poor have expenses,
and the middle class buys liabilities that they think are assets. He treats a house that one lives in as a liability, and a bigger house as a bigger liability. That
does not mean that he doesn’t like real estate though, quite the opposite - he made his initial fortune and quit his day job because of a successful real estate side
business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The basic tools for financial literacy are understanding assets and liabilities. And understanding how the income made and expenses incurred result in cash flows into and
from assets and liabilities The income earned by the middle class flows into liabilities, and expenses. Whereas the rich generate income from assets. A quite remarkable
example is the fast food chain McDonalds. The CEO of McDonalds, Ray Kroc, famously asked students what business he was in. They laughed and said of course hamburgers.
But he said that McDonalds was in fact in the real estate business, and not the hamburger business. McDonalds is one of the world’s largest real estate companies and
has a unique arrangement with it’s franchises to whom it leases its land at a marked up price. Kiyosaki illustrates that one should know the difference between
one’s business and one’s profession. Business translates into multiple complex life decisions, whereas one’s profession is only a piece of the entire puzzle. Kiyosaki
of course talks about how to shield from taxes by forming the right sort of company. In regards to working in a job, Kiyosaki says that you should work to learn, rather than working to earn money. Look down the road at skills you wish to acquire, before choosing a profession and potentially getting
trapped in the rat race.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final section of his book is titled “Teach and you shall receive.” This particularly resonates with me, as I like teaching in various formats. And recently with the online
education explosion, I have found much truth to this statement - from students who enjoy my online resources to those who read my blogs and research articles and for lifelong
collaborations. Youtuber David Perrel (according to another youtuber Ali Abdaal) makes a wonderful statement about online writing. He says think about if you live in a small
village and don’t go out too much - your contacts, interactions, and ideas are limited to those from within the village. But what if you take a trip every week to a far away place?
You might meet all sorts of people with all sorts of ideas, have serendipitous connections and broaden your mind. So go forth and put your work out there.
You might never know all the possible value for your approach, and you might be useful. It’s not possible to imagine all the future possibilities and opportunities
that could result from just putting your work out there. I say this from first hand experience. Multiple times. Even though I’m not super popular. If I can do it, so can you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on a suggestion by the incredible Youtuber &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjoxkxM_I5g&quot;&gt;Ali Abdaaal&lt;/a&gt;, I’m going to summarize 3 key points I learnt from this book as well as 3 quotes that stood out:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;3-takeaways&quot;&gt;3 Takeaways:&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The rich get richer because their assets generate more than enough income to cover expenses. The middle class struggles because their primary income is through salary. As salaries rise, so do taxes. And middle class income is spent towards liabilities. Assets are dissolved to help pay for uncovered expenses.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The McDonalds example teaches that sometimes one’s business is different from one’s profession. Recently I’ve come across Youtube study channels - the person makes money by sharing their screen and surroundings while they are studying, and viewers watch their videos and probably study alongside. These people are literally making assets out of just their immediate surroundings and making money off it, while their profession is what they are studying for (e.g. medical school).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Don’t work for money - rather, work to learn&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;3-quotes&quot;&gt;3 Quotes:&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“Be an observer, not a reactor to your emotions. Most people do not know that it is their emotions that are doing the thinking. Your emotions are
your emotions, but you have got to do the thinking.”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“Work to learn - don’t work for money”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“Each dollar in my asset column was a great employee, working hard to make more employees and buy the boss a new Porsche.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;caveats&quot;&gt;Caveats&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Serendipitously, I found an &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/swlh/were-not-getting-financially-smarter-by-reading-rich-dad-poor-dad-728c6c62fc4a&quot;&gt;article by Tim Denning&lt;/a&gt;
as I finished up this article, on the very same book! He points out how Kiyosaki does not exactly give the best financial advice these days. So keep this in mind that this post is not
a thumbs up for all of Kiyosaki’s advice. And this post is not financial advice. It represents my thoughts on a financial best seller, and my learnings from it.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Skanda Vivek</name></author><category term="blog" /><category term="Books" /><summary type="html">I was pleasantly surprised this financial best seller emphasizes the mindset of creating value for the life you want, rather than running after money.

But I would argue that mental training is as important (if not more) than physical training. The difference is that when you train your body, you see improvements when you look at yourself in the mirror. This positive feedback gives you motivation to continue exercising as part of a weekly regimen. In most cases, the mirror is a true physical reflection of your physical self. However, there is no such reflection of an improving mental prowess. Nevertheless, it is extremely important to train the mind. Think about your daily life - how many times do you need to do heavy physical labor like farm work? As compared to how much time do you spend using your brain to solve complex problems - sitting at your computer, or discussing with co-workers, or teaching someone else?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;a href=&quot;/assets/images2/gandhi.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images2/gandhi.png&quot; alt=&quot;Portrait of Gandhi by Indrajit Das&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gandhi summarizes his life’s work as a never ending search for truth. In the final farewell chapter, he summarizes what he has learnt through years of perseverence:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“To attain [perfection], one has to become absolutely passion-free in thought, speech and action; to rise above the opposing currents of love and hatred, attachment and repulsion”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;gandhi-in-south-africa&quot;&gt;Gandhi in South Africa&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before reading this book I had some conception that Gandhi spent sometime in South Africa. However, I was unaware how vital his time in South Africa was, for his contribution to India. It was in South Africa that he formed his most valuable ideas, including the concept of Satyagraha. Gandhi spent more than two decades from 1893-1914 in South Africa, in order to practice law and represent Indians in cases. Considering he went there when he was only 23, shows the impact South Africa had when he was in his formative years. While he went there for a specific case, in order to represent an Indian merchant, he immediately encountered intense racism in South Africa, directed towards Indians. He spent much time organizing peaceful protests, and fighting injustice through the legal system. As a lawyer, Gandhi was uniquely poised simultaneously as a man of knowledge, reputation, and respect for existing judicial systems, while at the same time his quest for the truth and justice made him the champion of underrepresented and persecuted Indians living in South Africa. For a long time, Gandhi was convinced that these racial injustices were limited to South Africa, and that the British rule was good in general.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gandhi’s good deeds in South Africa made him famous in India. In 1896, Gandhi visited India to visit his family, and also to educate the people in the Indian National Congress about the plight of Indians in South Africa. It was then that he started being aware of the defects in the British rule. In one particular incident, for Queen Victoria’s diamond jubilee event he decided to join along in the reciting of the British national anthem. A verse in particular stood out for Gandhi, as he describes in his chapter “Two Passions:”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“O Lord our God arise,
Scatter her enemies
And make them fall;
Confound their politics,
Frustrate their knavish tricks,
On Thee our hopes we fix,
God, save us all!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This marked the beginning of his questioning of the British rule in India, and eventual struggle for India’s freedom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-to-choose&quot;&gt;How to choose?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In today’s world we are faced with so many choices. For me personally, it is often hard to make a choice. There’s so many options of what research to prioritize, which blogging platform to use, whether to invest time in starting a newsletter, and even smaller decisions of what font size to use. I recognize this as a specific aspect that I need to train towards - efficient decision making. But I’m particularly inspired by an incident that showed Gandhi’s thought process during decision making.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When he had gone back to India in 1896, he started noticing the strain of daily Indian life due to the British rule. When he was speaking with members from the Indian National Congress about supporting the cause for Indians in South Africa, he angered some members, in particular one Pestonji Padshah. He said to Gandhi: ‘It is impossible to help you. Is there a lack of work in our own country? Let us win self-government here and we shall automatically help our countrymen there.’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gandhi could definitely understand this point of view and was faced by the important decision: give up work in South Africa and fight for India’s freedom, or go back to South Africa to complete the work to improve the conditions of Indians there? In making a choice, Gandhi went to the Bhagvad Gita, an Indian epic detailing the ambivalence of the great Indian warrior Arjuna during the Mahabharatha war, in fighting for the truth, but requiring to make great sacrifices and decisions in the process. Paraphrasing a key paragraph:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This is better that one do,
His own task as he may, even though he fail,
Than take tasks not his own, though they seem good,
To die performing duty is no ill:
But who seeks other roads shall wander still.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I understand this beautiful paragraph as echoing multiple content creators who say “find your niche” -  whether on Medium or Youtube.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-larger-picture&quot;&gt;The larger picture&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gandhi’s case study shows how having a self-critical mindset with the intent of finding truth in everyday life can lead to the great outcomes, even the freedom of a country. I must point out the caveat that there are many flaws to Gandhi as a person, and questions on whether Gandhi’s contributions were necessary for Indian freedom. Nevertheless, Gandhi is one of the most famous (if not the most famous) Indians, and his philosophies of non-violence and the incessant search for truth have impacted the entire world. That in of itself is testament to his beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interestingly enough, until Gandhi ultimately came to India in his mid 40’s he did not seriously consider freedom of Indian under the British rule as a motivating factor. He was just extremely aware of the injustices around him, and did his best to fix them. This mental attitude alone led him to solve societies big problems of the time. In fact, when he returned to India in 1900, with the intent to settle down in Mumbai and practice at the bar, he was immediately summoned back to South Africa to meet the Prime Minister of U.K., Mr. Chamberlain. Throughout his life, Gandhi accepted calls from people who needed his support, and also ultimately when his whole country needed him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a physicist, I draw parallels with the emergence of large scale macroscopic properties from microscopic interactions. A crystal is composed of individual atoms that don’t know how to place themselves, yet a beautiful structure emerges. How is this possible? This is due to the microscopic interactions between individual molecules, leading to emergent patterns. The same goes for my professional activities - I strive to make the best choice in the moment, without explicitly knowing what results these decisions might make in the larger picture. But with the hope that decades later, a story that made a difference will emerge.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Skanda Vivek</name></author><category term="blog" /><category term="Books" /><summary type="html">Reading Gandhi’s autobiography last year opened up my eyes to the importance of mental discipline and training, which is not often as discussed as physical training.
