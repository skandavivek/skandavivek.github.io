I'm an assistant professor of physics at Georgia Gwinnett College, and received [my PhD in physics at Emory University](https://www.pnas.org/content/114/8/1850). Prior to joining GGC I was a post-doctoral fellow at GeorgiaTech, and studied the impacts of [large-scale vehicular hacks on transportation networks](https://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.100.012316).

Currently, my interests are in studying cyber-physical vulnerabilities across complex networks, using interdisciplinary, data based approaches to build resilient societies. Our work has been published across multiple scientific journals and broadcasted by news outlets such as BBC and Forbes.

I'm also a scientific content creator. I regularly write blogs at the interface of complex systems, and data science for the social good in [Medium](https://skanda-vivek.medium.com/). I've made an open-acess textbook to teach non-science majors science through [examples of everyday phenomena](https://alg.manifoldapp.org/projects/science-of-everyday-materials). I also collaborate with educational publishers like Pearson to make educational videos. If you are interested in collaborating, shoot me an email <skanda.vivek@gmail.com>!
